<p>A typical <em>walk</em> would be about an <em>hour-long.</em> We’d explore your local area together or go on hikes together. $10 Hikes are $20 (includes gas)</p></div>

<div class="columns"><h4>Dog Sitting</h4>

<p>I would go to your house to take care of your dog. We would go out for <em>walks</em> up to <em>2-3 times a day</em>. They will be <em>fed twice a day</em>, and we would <strong>follow your schedule</strong>. So your dogs will feel comfortable that you are away and not full of anxiety. Of course, there will be lots of cuddles until you come home $40</p></div>

<div class="columns"><h4>Cat Check-In’s </h4>

<p>Check-ins are when I can come to your house while your away to check in on your cat/s and feed them once a day and clean their cat box. I stay about <em>1-2 hours at your house</em> so they won’t feel lonely. I can also water your plants, give basic care medication and pick up your mail.$10/$20 for a stay over </p></div>
