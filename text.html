<h4>Dog walking </h4>

<p>A typical <em>walk</em> would be about an <em>hour-long.</em> We’d explore your local area together or go on hikes together. $10 Hikes are $20 (includes gas)</p>

<h4>Dog Sitting</h4>

<p>I would go to your house to take care of your dog. We would go out for <em>walks</em> up to <em>2-3 times a day</em>. They will be <em>fed twice a day</em>, and we would <strong>follow your schedule</strong>. So your dogs will feel comfortable that you are away and not full of anxiety. Of course, there will be lots of cuddles until you come home $40</p>

<h4>Cat Check-In’s </h4>

<p>Check-ins are when I can come to your house while your away to check in on your cat/s and feed them once a day and clean their cat box. I stay about <em>1-2 hours at your house</em>.I can also water your plants, give basic care medication and pick up your mail.$10/$20 for a stay over </p>

<h4>Pet Sitting </h4>

<p>It is for when you have a cat/s and dog/s do about the same to the dog sitting and the check-ins.

<!--extra information that go under in another page--> <h2>Housechecks</h2>

<p> Before I provice a service I would need to see the house and know your routine. I would also need to know where you keep essential pet care like food, toys, cat box essential, poop bags (if I need to bring my own), leashes and cleaning products. The other things I need to know is your routine, like feeding time and walking time. What I should look out for like my cat goes after my other cat when he’s bored or wants my attention. All of the pets have like quirks just like us. During my services I can also water your plants, give basic care medication and pick up your mail. </p>

<p>To set up your first house check, you can sign up here…</p>

<h2>About Me </h2>

<p>My name is Ariel Blouin from Sillery, Quebec, and I have a nice Mitsubishi RVR 2012. I also have a big mattu black cat named George. Also, my big goal in life is to one day have a cat and a rescue pup one day. I work in the Anglophone community as a social enterprise coordinator. I am indeed an anglophone, but do not fret I do speak French. I’m a bit of a unicorn.</p>

<p>I first started pet sitting for my parent’s friends for an extra income. So I began Purr.Fect Companion. I found it pretty unique that instead of making your pet leave the comfort of their home, they would be home and keep the schedule and feel much less stressed.</p>
